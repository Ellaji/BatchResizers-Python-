# BatchResizer-Python
Scripts for batch processing images 

To run this script, PIL or Pillow should be installed.
Also jpeg and png decoders (libraries) should be installed with PIl or Pillow.
There is an OS X (Mac) .DS_Store workaround in the script, which can be deleted for other operating systems.

In command line, cd to the script
Run with "python BatchResizer.py path" (fill in the path to the folder you have your images in)
The folder should not include anything else but images. 
No support (yet) for other image sizes then jpg or png.
